# Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges

## Overview:

Repository to follow the [dynamic programming course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk) by freeCodeCamp.org using python.

### Memoization Recipe:

1. Make it work.
   - Visualize the problem as a tree
   - Implement the tree using recursion
   - test it
2. Make it efficient.
   - Add a memo object
   - Add a base case to return memo values
   - Store return values into the memo

### Tabulation Recipe:

- Visualize the problem as a table;
- Size the table based on the inputs;
- Initialize the table with default values;
- Seed the trivial asnwer into the table;
- Iterate through the table;
- Fill futher positions based on the current position;
